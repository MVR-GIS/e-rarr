dredged material volumes early in the study (from 5MCY to well over 20 MCY). The risk is ensuring there is sufficient capacity in identified placement sites to accommodate the volumes both for the initial construction and the 20-year O&amp;M. Current Placement Area opportunities include Egmont (nearshore/beach/island restoration), 2D, 3D, ODMDS, viable dredge holes (4), island creation (for private use, bird habitat creation, and seagrass restoration), permitted Port site, Manatee County boat launch site. Team will conduct least cost analysis. Viable options that are not least cost will be pursued to see if there is a cost sharing partner to pay incremental difference.","EN recalls that TECO possibly has a gas line that intersects the proposed project area. EN mentioned that the subsurface utilities did not interfere with the previous plans to Widen Cut-B. To mitigate risk, it is necessary to obtain a map of all subsurface utilities.","The PDT's available funding as of 1-JUN will likely only last the PDT through June. When SAJ requested additional funding in May, funding was denied and the MSC/HW indicated additional study funds may not be approved until a decision on the exception request is made","Widening for passing lanes would be conducted from the centerline of the channel rather than to one side only. Deepening of the channel would impact hardbottoms (HB) on both sides of the channel; however the difference of deepening impacts compared to the widening impacts to these HB are unknown. There is a risk of greatly increasing HB impacts from widening both sides of the channel over the impacts resulting from deepening alone. \r\nAdditional HB surveys (in situ, qualitative, and quantitative) may be required to assess impacts if widening is determined to cause impacts over deepening alone. Additional mitigation may be required if impacts are greater","There will be a gap in Federal funding streams for the study after the AMM. NFS can accelerate their share of the funding. Three various efforts are in play during the spring (earmark, workplan, infrastructure bill) which could help in getting needed Federal funding.\r\n\r\n15-FEB-22: Funding from IIJA was approved in early 2022 to fully fund the Federal portion of the study at $3M. Based on the $4.5M study budget, these federal funds will be sufficient to fund the study through the TSP (Spring 2023)","The team is currently not pursuing a Programmatic Agreement (PA), but to reduce risk will conduct needed surveys for placement areas during feasibility. Channel is generally already surveyed but there could be some additional surveys","If placement options are not decided upon with enough time, then must include all in NEPA analysis, including potential surveys, which would take more time, funding, and effort","Scope necessitates a need for a policy exception for an additional $1.5M to perform the needed analysis through the TSP. Exception request was submitted in early 2022. There is some risk and uncertainty as to whether a policy exception will be granted.","Environmental compliance such as a BO could require more extensive seagrass/channel edge surveys. Multibeam and camera drops could be needed to provide additional information. Study will use side scan sonar to better understand extent of hardbottom along channel, to complete environmental compliance during feasibility for effects analysis. Study will use existing seagrass surveys to begin assumptions for effects analysis and could propose to complete final surveys in PED/prior to construction to refine placement locations to avoid seagrass or refine effects as needed.","Team will use UMAM for impacts analysis, NMFS HCD is onboard. There could be risk if support changes","Team has evaluated scopes relative to key problems, for multiple parameters of time and funding, under 9 key risk drivers. This scope still has many challenges but the over risk to completing it in the funding/timeframe is medium. The team will proceed with scope 2 for the study analysis, per Port decision at meeting on 12/8/2021 (analysis of incremental deepening, incremental wideners for transitions, passing lanes and turning basins, as well as beneficial use).","Study will include ship simulation during feasibility study for passing lane and turning basin analysis for design and optimization of footprint. Ensure have adequate time and funding to include it.","Risk that EQ/OSE/RED quantification benefits analysis is new, and many districts may be doing it differently, making it difficult to know what the standard process should be to meet policy requirements. Also, given the post-pandemic world many business and operations are changing and may change during or after the analysis.","Ensure that the proper design vessel(s) are selected/explored when evaluating the potential scope of the study. Risk of a poor planning decision if study team doesn't holistically look at the vessels utilized at the neighboring ports such as Mobile, New Orleans, and Houston.","Preliminary analysis shows that depths just off the outer entrance channel are ~50 feet. Potential deepening beyond that could cause a need to deepen beyond that, so ensure a gradual transition for vessels. This could have a large cost implication for the cost analysis pertaining to those alternatives.","Numerical modeling of disposal site suitability (waves/sediment transport) as well as effects of disposal sites (flushing/circulation) may be needed later, to support env compliance. The need, extent, and type of numerical modeling has not yet been identified. When the need/extent/type of numerical modeling is identified, it could be later in the study process leading to schedule delays and cost increases.","USCG ATONS will likely be affected from a TSP/recommended plan due to potential passing lanes. Relocations of ATONS must be coordinated with USCG and are also paid for Federally out of USCG. These take a lot of coordination and could be expensive. USCG needs time to vet and plan for these changes and costs. USCG may need more time or have funding constraints."],["Planning","Planning","Planning","Planning","Planning","Planning","Planning","Planning","Planning","Planning","Planning","Planning","Planning","Planning","Planning","Planning","Planning"],["Tentatively Selected Plan","Project Initiation","Tentatively Selected Plan","Agency Decision","Tentatively Selected Plan","Tentatively Selected Plan","Tentatively Selected Plan","Tentatively Selected Plan","Tentatively Selected Plan","Tentatively Selected Plan","Project Initiation","Tentatively Selected Plan","Tentatively Selected Plan","Project Initiation","Tentatively Selected Plan","Agency Decision","Tentatively Selected Plan"],["Likely","Likely","Likely","Likely","Very Unlikely","Unlikely","Likely","Likely","Likely","Very Unlikely","Very Unlikely","Unlikely","Likely","Unlikely","Likely","Likely","Likely"],["Planning - Plan Formulation","Engineering - Structural Design","Planning - Plan Formulation","Engineering - Hydrology and Hydraulics","Project Management","Planning - Cultural Resources","Planning - Environmental","Planning - Plan Formulation","Planning - Environmental","Planning - Environmental","Planning - Plan Formulation","Engineering - Structural Design","Planning - Economics","Planning - Economics","Engineering - Structural Design","Engineering - Hydrology and Hydraulics","Planning - Plan Formulation"],["Other","Other","Other","Other","Agency Strategy","Other","Other","Other","Other","Other","Other","Other","Other","Other","Other","Other","Other"],["Low","Low","Moderate","Low","Low","Low","Low","Low","Low","Low","Low","Low","Low","Low","Low","Low","Low"],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,120,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],["Opportunity","Opportunity","Moderate","Opportunity","Opportunity","Opportunity","Opportunity","Opportunity","Opportunity","Opportunity","Opportunity","Opportunity","Opportunity","Opportunity","Opportunity","Opportunity","Opportunity"]],"container":"<table class=\"display\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th>RISK<\/th>\n      <th>RISK NAME<\/th>\n      <th>RISK CATEGORY<\/th>\n      <th>RISK STATEMENT<\/th>\n      <th>PHASE<\/th>\n      <th>MILESTONE<\/th>\n      <th>LIKELIHOOD<\/th>\n      <th>DISCIPLINE<\/th>\n      <th>PERFORMANCE IMPACT TYPE<\/th>\n      <th>PERFORMANCE RANKING<\/th>\n      <th>COST IMPACT<\/th>\n      <th>SCHEDULE IMPACT<\/th>\n      <th>SCHEDULE RANKING<\/th>\n    <\/tr>\n  <\/thead>\n<\/table>","options":{"buttons":["copy","csv","excel","pdf"],"lengthMenu":[[20,40,60,-1],["20","40","60","All"]],"paging":false,"columnDefs":[{"className":"dt-right","targets":[10,11]}],"order":[],"autoWidth":false,"orderClasses":false,"orderCellsTop":true}},"evals":[],"jsHooks":[]}</script>
