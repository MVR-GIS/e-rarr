HTRW sites have been reviewed previously which found a few sites in the proximity of the alignments; however, site status are subject to change, and new sites may be present. The risk associated with the presence of HTRW sites along the alignment is primarily associated with the need to revise the alignment footprint design to avoid/minimize impacts to the HTRW site and/or schedule delays (with associated costs of such delays while pending remedial action at 100% non-federal cost when there is no other practicable solution, and potential need to prepare ECP report(s) should acquisition of a property be necessary and the HTRW site history is in question (e.g. 207 Pond Avenue).

This could result in study delays, outcome risk, poor planning decision
Consequence: Regional system may not be considered thoroughly enough to ""reverse"" adverse effects from existing efforts, and may cause new adverse effects. Miscalculating risks and consequences across the whole Lower Mississippi River system could result in new adverse impacts.
Evidence: Mega studies typically require 5years. Coastal Texas Study, the largest mega study to date, required 120 active PDT members for only one state (Texas) . The study already had a 2-year Master Plan that preceded the study start and still took 5 years. If LMR Comp only has 4 years total due to lost time, the need to serve 6 states across multiple districts with diverging interests, 4 years does not seem realistic to create a meaningful re-working of the entire Lower Mississippi River system. This opportunity to reenvision the river will likely  only once in a lifetime, so it is crucial to have sufficient time for meaningful work.
Risk Management: To reduce risk, P0 team will coordinate further. P0 Team will seek an Exemption to IG to identify a start date of right now, a start date at a future FCSA date, start date of when P0 PDT timeline ends, or have a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU)
