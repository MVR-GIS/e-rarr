Conservative assumptions will be applied for feasibility level assessment of any alternatives containing levee improvements / construction and cost risk analysis will be applied and utilized in accordance with the identified risk for various measures and plans considered. Those key assumptions are based upon extensive experience at other projects along the Missouri River and include the use of underseepage berms and sand drains at all levee locations and stability berms where levee height exceeds fifteen feet. This effectively transfers the cost of drilling to PED, but does not transfer significant risk of cost overruns due to inadequate site characterization because of the adopted conservative assumptions.

by adopting the following assumptions. This is believed to be a conservative approach
based on recent experience in other areas along the Missouri River and has been closely
coordinated between District and Division staff with extensive MO River geotechnical
experience. This transfers the cost of drilling to PED, but due to the conservative
assumptions does not transfer an undue amount of risk of future cost over-runs.
