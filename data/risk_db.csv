Mitigation for private boating impacts could include a public boat ramp and associated facilities as part of the project.  Development of the river side of the divider island peninsula and/or opposite bank of the river could serve to mitigate these known project impacts.  Lock cycle times must not be diminished to the extent that it causes a mode shift to other means of goods transportation.,NA,Loren Wobig,Open,REGEN-9,Level 1,10/13/2021 1:00,#EER,10/25/2022 9:45

It's a formal industrial site and dredge placement site with unknown disposal with potential to high impacts to cost and schedule. There was a lawsuit regarding potential ground water contamination at various NRG sites.  Note this risk is related to risk RE-1 Land Acquisition in two ways.  First we are dependent on land access (Rights of Entry for Exploration) being acquired to conduct the investigation.  If we do not get access then the Phase II analysis cannot be completed and the land acquisition for construction cannot be completed.  Second the results of a Phase II investigation could dictate that it is not feasible to acquire the site which is essentially the risk concern of RE-1 Land Acquisition of the preferred site cannot be acquired.,NA,Bob Spencer,Open,EN-1,Level 1,7/22/2021 1:00,NA,10/25/2022 10:11
