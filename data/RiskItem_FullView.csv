This could result in study delays, outcome risk, poor planning decision
Consequence: Regional system may not be considered thoroughly enough to ""reverse"" adverse effects from existing efforts, and may cause new adverse effects. Miscalculating risks and consequences across the whole Lower Mississippi River system could result in new adverse impacts.
Evidence: Mega studies typically require 5years. Coastal Texas Study, the largest mega study to date, required 120 active PDT members for only one state (Texas) . The study already had a 2-year Master Plan that preceded the study start and still took 5 years. If LMR Comp only has 4 years total due to lost time, the need to serve 6 states across multiple districts with diverging interests, 4 years does not seem realistic to create a meaningful re-working of the entire Lower Mississippi River system. This opportunity to reenvision the river will likely  only once in a lifetime, so it is crucial to have sufficient time for meaningful work.
Risk Management: To reduce risk, P0 team will coordinate further. P0 Team will seek an Exemption to IG to identify a start date of right now, a start date at a future FCSA date, start date of when P0 PDT timeline ends, or have a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU)
