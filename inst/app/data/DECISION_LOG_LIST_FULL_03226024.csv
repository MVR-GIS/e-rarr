We will be using Episodic Riverine Module of CRAM (California Rapid Assessment Method). It is intended to be used in context with the User’s Manual of CRAM (ver. 6.1; CWMW 2013). It was developed as a modification of the field book for riverine wetlands (ver. 6.1), termed the standard riverine CRAM module. 
 
The episodic riverine CRAM module is based on the fundamental assumptions and relationships between condition and function shared between all CRAM modules. Four universal attributes of condition are recognized: (1) Buffer and landscape context; (2) Hydrology; (3) Physical structure; and (4) Biotic structure. However, the metrics comprising these attributes have been adapted to account for the unique characteristics of predominantly dry episodic waterways.

CRAM is a cost-effective and scientifically defensible rapid assessment method for monitoring and assessing the ecological conditions of wetlands throughout California. It takes less than half a day to assess a wetland area, and is designed evaluate the condition of the wetland based on its landscape setting, hydrology, physical structure and biological structure.  Because the methodology is standardized for over seven types of wetlands, ecological condition scores can be compared at the local, regional and statewide landscape scales.  CRAM can also be used to assess the performance of compensatory mitigation projects and restoration projects. The easy-to-use, online data entry forms ensures that all of the appropriate site information and field data associated with CRAM assessments can be archived online and access by environmental managers, planners, and stakeholders to inform wetland management and planning decisions. The ability to draw the CRAM assessment area online using an aerial image of the site, makes it easy for CRAM practitioners to enter their site information making it available on EcoAtlas (if allowed by the landowner).
