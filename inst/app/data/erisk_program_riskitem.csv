This current pulls water away from Florida coast and brings warm water to the north Atlantic. As climate change slows down the velocity of the Gulf Stream, less water will be pulled away from the east coast and the relative sea level in Florida will increase. The team can either quantify this relative sea level increase or simply acknowledge the sea level increase during the planning phase of this study.	
Choosing to simply acknowledge the decreased velocity of the Gulf Stream may result in the BBSEER team underestimating the relative sea level during the lifespan of the project. However, there is limited information with which to make an accurate, quantified prediction of relative sea level as Gulf Stream velocity decreases. An attempt to quantify this, while costing additional time and money, may result in inaccurate results and, therefore, study analytical errors.

This could result in study delays, outcome risk, poor planning decision
Consequence: Regional system may not be considered thoroughly enough to ""reverse"" adverse effects from existing efforts, and may cause new adverse effects. Miscalculating risks and consequences across the whole Lower Mississippi River system could result in new adverse impacts.
Evidence: Mega studies typically require 5years. Coastal Texas Study, the largest mega study to date, required 120 active PDT members for only one state (Texas) . The study already had a 2-year Master Plan that preceded the study start and still took 5 years. If LMR Comp only has 4 years total due to lost time, the need to serve 6 states across multiple districts with diverging interests, 4 years does not seem realistic to create a meaningful re-working of the entire Lower Mississippi River system. This opportunity to reenvision the river will likely  only once in a lifetime, so it is crucial to have sufficient time for meaningful work.
Risk Management: To reduce risk, P0 team will coordinate further. P0 Team will seek an Exemption to IG to identify a start date of right now, a start date at a future FCSA date, start date of when P0 PDT timeline ends, or have a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU)

This upland elevation directly informs the ground surface elevation and first floor elevation (FFE) of structures. Event-specific damages are directly dependent upon FFE. The PDT specified an upland elevation based on the average elevation of a set of sample points within a planning reach. This neglects variability in ground surface elevation within a planning reach. 

Under a significant storm event, it is likely that damages will be underestimated for a subset of structures, though it is also likely that damages will be overestimated for a separate subset of structures. The PDT has agreed to assume that, in aggregate, these potential over/underestimations are likely to cancel each other out. Consequently, the PDT has made the risk-informed decision that additional the work needed to increase the model fidelity is unlikely to provide any meaningful change to estimated economic performance or plan formulation outcomes.

There remains a risk that at a future point in time, this additional model fidelity may be required to differentiate between alternatives. Should this risk be realized, additional work would be required to specify ground surface elevations on a per-structure basis.

Limitations:
1) Water table at Line 1 can be as shallow as 10 feet BGS.

The hydrologic study strategy is formulated on the premise that interior facilities (that will be a component of the recommended plan) will be planned and evaluated separately (incrementally) from the line-of-protection project. The major project feature (levee/floodwall) is conceptually divided from the planned interior facilities by initially evaluating a ""minimum"" interior facility considered integral to the line-of-protection. If a levee/floodwall is in existence, the minimum interior facility is presently in place, and no special efforts are required to establish the separation. If a levee is being proposed (planned), the minimum facility must be formulated and the evaluation of the line-of-protection benefits performed with the facility in place. The residual interior flooding problem is the target of the interior facility planning efforts, and benefits attributable to the increased interior facilities will be the reduction in the residual damage. 
(2) The minimum facilities are intended to be the starting point from which additional interior facilities planning will begin. The criteria suggested below for determining the minimum facility are intended to yield facilities that can be quickly and easily determined. The facilities will, with rare exception, be found inadequate upon further interior facility planning; thus, increased facilities will be formulated, evaluated, and included as a component of the recommended line-of-protection plan that is, in turn, an incrementally justified component of the overall flood control project. It is expected that the interior facilities included in the final plan will provide interior area flood relief for residual flooding.",1,Very Unlikely,Very Unlikely (5% to 30%),Actual risk likelihood is unknown but it is a possibility.,NA,4,Engineering - Hydrology and Hydraulics,EHH,9731,Kathryn Skalbeck,5,Other,NA,5,Minor Problem,0,No Risk,0,100000,0,"If the IDA is deemed incorrect, the H&H will have to be reviewed for technical feasibility & the IDA rerun per technical review comments.

3,PLE-3,5172,Honolulu Deep Draft Harbor Modifications Feasibility Study,NA,Honolulu District(POH),NA,445194,POH,Performance of Navigation Improvements in Emergency,Info and Data Analysis,1,"The potential navigation improvements (e.g., widening Fort Armstrong Entrance Channel) aim to reduce the occurrence and duration of Port Shutdowns caused by vessel casualties and coastal storms. The risk and impacts of these events involves high uncertainty. Similarly, the successful performance of navigation improvements during an emergency situation is not certain. As a result, there is significant performance and reputational risk associated with navigation improvements.

Emergency management agencies will likely update emergency plans incorporating assumptions about the improvements associated with this project. This risks diverting resources for potentially more effective risk management and resiliency measures (e.g., improving emergency infrastructure at other Hawaii Ports).

The navigation improvements will likely have significant cost that are not economically justified by NED metrics alone. Project justification will likely rely on the ability of the project to keep the Port open during an emergency, which is not a certainty. If the alternative, which is designed to prevent Port shutdown, does not perform successfully, the USACE and HDOT face reputational risk.

Additionally, USACE and HDOT do not directly manage the risk associated with navigation in the channels beyond channel design and maintenance. Navigating the channel is the role of the Hawaii Pilots and vessel captains. Channel improvements could cause a change in behavior (e.g., faster transit through the entrance and two-way meeting) which could create new risks to the channel and port shutdown potential.",5,Extremely Likely,Extremely Likely (90% to 100%),"There is limited historical record for port shutdowns resulting from vessel casualties. Predicting where and how a vessel casualty will occur and whether channel improvements change that risk involves significant uncertainty.

During tropical storms, the navigation channel is less likely to be the bottleneck to reopening the harbor than landside infrastructure. The incremental benefit of the proposed navigation improvements is very difficult to assess.",NA,15,Planning - Economics,PLE,2264,Walker Messer,4,Operations,The study will make assumptions regarding the performance of the project alternatives in terms of reduced shutdown days in the event of an emergency.

As of 2024, we have approximately $17M left in the authority with $13.8M at the District available for this project. If we are to achieve a portion of the goals as described in the 2012 USACE Master Plan which sets forth the goal of restoring approximately 3,900 acres in the Tangier-Pocomoke Sound we will need an increase in project authority. USACE cannot lobby for funds but we will need to develop a project scope and cost estimate to understand how much money it will take to achieve these goals. The risk would be that we do not get enough of an authorization increase to achieve the Master Plan goal which is the basis for our Decision Document. We will have enough to construct the nearshore reefs but this risk is solely to describe the risk associated with constructing the harvest/sanctuary reefs.",4,Very Likely,Very Likely (70% to 90%),"There is currently a $20M authorization increase proposed in the Senate WRDA24 bill, however this is not guaranteed to pass through.
